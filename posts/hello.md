#### I guess we'll start with the basics...

I'm 32, I live in Birmingham, I play the saxophone, I love music, art and design, I'm a plant mom, I love the outdoors, travelling, climbing mountains and wild swimming, I enjoy baking, gardening and cycling, I love food (cooking and eating), and more recently (and excitingly) I have come to love coding!

#### My early years...

As the daughter of two musicians, my passion for music began at an early age and I grew up immersed in a world of creativity and sounds. Although a classically trained flautist in my early years I went on to study the saxophone in my teens and thanks to a couple of awe-inspiring teachers I began to develop a life-long love of jazz and improvisation. Growing up, I also really enjoyed other things such as cycling, swimming and reading, and I always had an interest in science and how things work (hence my strange combination of A levels - Chemistry, Music and English Literature!). However, I had my heart set on becoming a professional musician and after school I went on to study on the BA (Hons) Jazz course at [Leeds Conservatoire](https://www.leedsconservatoire.ac.uk/). I had a fantastic time!

#### It's all about that jazz...

Since graduating from [Leeds Conservatoire](https://www.leedsconservatoire.ac.uk/) in 2010 I have been working as a professional musician and music teacher. I've had the opportunity to meet and work with some amazing people and travel around a fair bit, living in Yorkshire, the Lake District, Dublin and Worcester before finally settling in Birmingham!

##### _I loved having the mountains on my doorstep when I lived in the Lake District and I've climbed over 100 Wainwrights. I'm hoping to get to the summit of all of them in the next few years!_ ‚õ∞Ô∏è

I've been involved with a number of different jazz, pop and rock bands and have been fortunate to play some awesome gigs at festivals like Glastonbury, Leeds & Reading, Kendal Calling and Wilderness (to name a few!).

##### _Playing at Reading Festival on the BBC Introducing stage (spot the big hair!)_ üé§

More recently I have been performing with a Pink Floyd tribute band called [UK Pink Floyd Experience](https://www.ukpinkfloydexperience.com/) (UKPFE) and up until earlier this year I was touring the UK theatre circuit with them playing the saxophone and singing backing vocals. We played in some beautiful theatres all over the country which was a brilliant experience!

##### _I had to swap very quickly between two saxophones when playing Shine On You Crazy Diamond with UKPFE which meant carrying one saxophone on my back and then doing a huge swing - yes it's as risky as it sounds!_ üé∑

As well as gigging, I have also spent the last decade doing a lot of teaching and I have worked with many fantastic schools, music services and arts organisations to provide inspirational music education to young people and adults. My work included one to one and group tuition, running bands and ensembles, putting on concerts, leading workshops, helping students to pass music exams and auditions, and most importantly giving people from all sorts of backgrounds the space, opportunity and confidence to channel and develop their creativity through music - which in turn went on to enrich their whole lives (that was the aim anyway)!

Like any job, it has had its challenges (often getting enough sleep!) but overall it has been exciting and enjoyable, and I‚Äôve had lots of fun along the way!

#### Time for a change...

However, over the past year 18 months I have been increasingly feeling like I am ready for a new challenge in life. Although I have absolutely loved working in the music industry for the past 10 years, I no longer want to do it as my full-time job. Seeing my partners journey into tech over the past year has been inspiring and intriguing (he also used to work as a professional musician) and it has opened up my eyes to a whole new exciting world of opportunity! Although I have always enjoyed using technology I had never considered it as a career before. Growing up, my brother always had an interest in computing (and now works in tech too!) but I was so immersed in music and the arts that I never even considered doing anything else. But seeing the rise of technology over the past two decades, how it is involved everywhere and integral to pretty much everything in our modern world, I've come to realise that it‚Äôs not something that is separate to the arts (or any subject) - rather it‚Äôs a new avenue to channel creativity, development and learning. It's the future - and one that I want to be part of!

#### Java-what...?

Since I started learning to code a few months ago I‚Äôve really taken to both the technical and creative aspects of programming. I've enjoyed the challenge of learning a new language and with lock-down since March (and therefore no gigs and very little teaching) I've had lots of time to learn. I've pretty much been a full time student which has been great! I have been amazed at how easy it is to access information and free, high-quality learning resources online - I've certainly had lots to keep me busy. In June, I heard about [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) for the first time and I decided to start doing it. I was coding most days anyway but it really added an extra incentive to keep up the study and I've loved finding an online community on Twitter to help me feel less alone in my learning endeavours. If you want to see what I've been up to you can check out my [#100DaysOfCode diary](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode) on Github or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/katie_hawcutt).

When the opportunity came to apply for the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp I jumped at the chance as I knew that this was something that I wanted to pursue and make my career. There are so many opportunities in tech right now and it's exciting to be moving into an industry that is thriving. I also like the fact that the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) is based in Birmingham. I am passionate about being in Birmingham as I think it's an awesome place with a lot to offer and I really want to work here and contribute to the tech and music communities here (still hoping to do a few gigs if I have time!).

#### A new reality...

And so here I am now... extremely excited, incredibly intrigued, a little apprehensive but super happy to be part of this next [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) cohort. I think it's going to be a life-changing few months and I can't wait to see where I'll be in 6 months time! Watch this space... üòÄ
